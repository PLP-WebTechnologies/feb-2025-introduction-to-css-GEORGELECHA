        <h1>PLP Web Dev week 3 Assignment</h1>
        <p>What can we then say about this life of a DEV? The life is good, full of the ups and downs but we thank the
            Lord and embrace doing tough things. These are the things that make us even stronger.</p>

        <h2>What have I leant up to now?</h2>
        <p>These things require practise overtime to master the syntax and how the process works. Failure to do
            practise, even a code you wrote 2 weeks ago and didn't practise on it, on viewing it or trying to
            understand, it seems like you are a beginner. What does this mean? If I get to practise this coding
            frequently, they get to sink into my long term memory and so obvious that I can write code that works even
            without referring somewhere. Coding help us develop good and a strong memory!</p>

            <h2>Why do I take this course?</h2>
            <p>Although I'm a medical student, my passion was always to do with technology, computers, what makes the
                computers run(programs) and even my parent took me to a school we were exposed to computing studies and
                we got the hang of things at early stages of our lives. This journey went on to highschool where I chose
                to do French and Computer Studies for my my half-time in highschool. Proceeding to 3RD year, I had to
                drop either one of the two. My mind was already made up to go with computer studies; though I performed
                very well in French. I was passionate about the subject to the level that I was spending so much of my
                time in the Comp Lab, regardless of the balance needed to perform overally well. I scored Computer
                Studies an A for the KSCE exams and was very happy with this. Going to the University, didn't get enough
                guidance from someone with Computer background. Most people around me( adult figures) were either in the
                education or health career sectors; thats why I was conviced to take Health Course; but passion was
                somewhere else.
            </p>

            <p>PLP has given me an opportunity to realize my dream and follow my passion. My goal is to be a backend
                developer; crafting apps, websites and complex systems that solve our daily problems. I'm on the journey
                to get the hang of things and apply them to help the world.</p>
